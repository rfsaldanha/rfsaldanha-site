## COVID-19 Monitoring

-   Fiocruz official [institutional dashboard]{.hl} for the pandemics
-   More than 10 data sources covering diverse aspects
-   Data gathering, harmonization, visualization and analysis
-   [Challenges]{.hl} on data availability, standardization, and information communication
-   [Daily work basis]{.hl}, high press demand for data and insights
-   Several technical notes, papers and a book chapter
-   Project awarded an [government prize]{.hl}

## Postdoc project

-   Montpellier University Inria Antenne, LIRMM
-   Dengue inflicts an important health burden in Brazil
    -   1 million new cases reported just in 2024, 214 deaths, official emergency status declaration
-   Project for [dengue incidence forecast]{.hl} on Brazil with machine learning methods
-   Novel subsets approach, cluster based models with better performance

## Research plans for the next years

-   Application of Data Science methods to Public Health challenges on the Global South
-   Streamline [health and climate indicators]{.hl} projects, expansion to other countries and continents
-   Usage of Machine Learning methods for data analysis and forecast, [Early Warning Systems]{.hl}

## Axis 1. Data and indicators

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Standardized methodology to build [health and climate indicators]{.hl}
-   Adoption of common time and spatial units (administrative regions)
-   Application of zonal statistics
-   Publication at [Environmental Data Science journal (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/eds.2024.3)

## Health and climate indicators

-   Provide [regularly updated datasets]{.hl} of health and climate indicators at different hierarchical administrative geographic boundaries
-   Expand coverage to other countries
-   Usage of population estimates as weighting factor
-   Build synthetic indicators for water cycle and droughts, warm and cold spells, and extreme events
-   Work close with the ClimatSuds project

## Axis 2. Early Warning System for Climate-Sensitive Diseases

-   Framework proposal to prevent and early detect CSD outbreaks on Global South countries, with [most vulnerable populations to climate change]{.hl}
-   Actual EWS are limited on countries coverage, quality, interpretation and usage for decision making
-   Aligned with WHO guidelines, replicable in other countries

## Early Warning System for Climate-Sensitive Diseases

-   [Multivariate models]{.hl} with climate, environmental and socio-economic predictors
-   Traditional and machine learning methods to forecast incidence for short and medium-time horizons (ARIMA, random forest, XGBoost, LSTM...)
-   Subsets models to boost performance
-   Continuous model monitoring and update (MLOps)

## Early Warning System for Climate-Sensitive Diseases

-   Lay an EWS framework adaptive to other regions' contexts and society priorities
-   Close work with health managers and civil society representatives for project usage and tools appropriation

## Axis 2. Healthcare access research

-   Study the healthcare access [networks]{.hl}
-   Observation of empirical data on the patients address and healthcare unit location
-   Adaptation of [Social Network Analysis (SNA)]{.hl} methods
-   Addresses are [nodes]{.hl}, healthcare events are [links]{.hl}
-   Metrics of [centrality]{.hl} of healthcare units, simulations on the effect of units creation and closing

## Integration with IRD

-   Research aligned with the SDGs Good Health and Well-Being (3), Climate Action (13), and Partnership for the Goals (17)
-   IRD equitable partnerships with the developing countries
-   UMR EspaceDev expertise on earth observation and modeling of health and climate data
-   ESOR group focus on environment, society, and health relationship on time and space, reach on South America, Africa and Asia countries
