## About me

-   Brazilian from Rio de Janeiro
-   Loves cycling and take pictures
-   Husband, father of dogs and a cat
-   Researcher on Health Geography and Climate-Sensitive Diseases
-   R developer

## Academia

-   BSc on Geography (2007) and Specialization on Statistics (2009). *Regionalization proposal based on Census data.*
-   Master's on Public Health (2017). *Spatio-temporal models to study the relationship between traffic violence and income.*
-   Doctorate on Health Information (Fiocruz, 2021). *Applications of Data Science methods on Public Health.*
-   Final year of a postdoc position at Inria. *Machine Learning methods application on Dengue forecast*.

## Main fields of work and projects

-   *Data gathering:* R packages to handle Brazilian health datasets, indicators, and climate data (self initiative)

`{microdatasus}`, `{brpop}`, `{tidyrates}`, `{brclimr}`

-   *Visualization:* malaria and COVID-19 interactive visualization dashboards (IRD and Fiocruz)
-   *Analysis and modeling* of climate-sensitive diseases (Fiocruz, LNCC, BSC, Inria, IRD)

## Cross-border malaria transmission

-   More than 10 data sources covering diverse aspects
-   Data gathering, harmonization, visualization and analysis
-   Challenges on data availability, standardization, and information communication
-   Daily work basis, high press demand for data and insights
-   Several technical notes, papers and a book chapter
-   Project awarded an government prize

## Research on Health and Climate indicators

## Postdoc project

-   Montpellier University Inria Antenne, LIRMM
-   Dengue inflicts an important health burden in Brazil
    -   1 million new cases reported just in 2024, 214 deaths, official emergency status declaration
-   Project for dengue incidence forecast on Brazil with machine learning methods
-   Novel subsets approach, cluster based models with better performance

## Research plans for the next years

-   Application of Data Science methods to Public Health challenges on the Global South
-   Streamline health and climate indicators projects, expansion to other countries and continents
-   Usage of Machine Learning methods for data analysis and forecast, Early Warning Systems

## Health and climate indicators harmonization

-   Provide regularly updated datasets of health and climate indicators at different hierarchical administrative geographic boundaries
-   Expand coverage to other countries
-   Usage of population estimates as weighting factor
-   Build synthetic indicators for water cycle and droughts, warm and cold spells, and extreme events
-   Work close with the ClimatSuds project

## Early Warning System for Climate-Sensitive Diseases

-   Framework proposal to prevent and early detect CSD outbreaks on Global South countries, with most vulnerable populations to climate change
-   Actual EWS are limited on countries coverage, quality, interpretation and usage for decision making
-   Aligned with WHO guidelines, replicable in other countries

## Early Warning System for Climate-Sensitive Diseases

-   Multivariate models with climate, environmental and socio-economic predictors
-   Traditional and machine learning methods to forecast incidence for short and medium-time horizons (ARIMA, random forest, XGBoost, LSTM...)
-   Subsets models to boost performance
-   Continuous model monitoring and update (MLOps)

## Early Warning System for Climate-Sensitive Diseases

-   Lay an EWS framework adaptive to other regions' contexts and society priorities
-   Close work with health managers and civil society representatives for project usage and tools appropriation

## Integration with IRD

-   Research aligned with the SDGs Good Health and Well-Being (3), Climate Action (13), and Partnership for the Goals (17)
-   IRD equitable partnerships with the developing countries
-   UMR EspaceDev expertise on earth observation and modeling of health and climate data
-   ESOR group focus on environment, society, and health relationship on time and space, reach on South America, Africa and Asia countries

## Thanks!
