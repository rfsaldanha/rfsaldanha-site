## About me

-  Brazilian from Rio de Janeiro
-  Loves to ride a bike and take pictures
-  Husband, father of dogs and a cat
-  Works with Health Geography and Climate Sensitive Diseases
-  R coder and package developer

## Academia

-  Undergraduate on Geography (2007) and Specialization on Statistics (2009)
-  Master's on Public Health (2017)
-  PhD on Health Information and Communication (Fiocruz, 2021)
-  Final year of a postdoc position at Inria, working with Machine Learning methods

## Main projects

-  Data gathering: R packages for Brazilian health data and indicators, climate data  
      - `{microdatasus}`, `{brpop}`, `{tidyrates}`, `{brclimr}`
-  Visualization: malaria and COVID-19 interactive visualization dashboards
-  Analysis and modeling of healthcare access and climate-sensitive diseases

## microdatasus

-  R package to work with raw data from the Brazilian Health Ministry
-  Functions to download, read and pre-process data
-  Facilitates everyday work on health data handling
-  Widely adopted

## Cross-border malaria dashboard

-  Partnership between Fiocruz and IRD
-  Harmonized dataset of cross-border malaria incidence at Brazil (Amap√°) and French Guiana
-  Construction of interactive visualization dashboard (R Shiny)
-  Different languages and cultures, visualization is the key
-  One month work visit at MTD and a field work at Cayenne
-  Publication at Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR, 2019)

## Covid-19 dashboard

-  Fiocruz official institutional dashboard for the pandemics
-  Data gathering, harmonization, visualization and analysis
-  Full framework pipeline with R
-  Challenges on data availability, standardization, and health information communication to the community
-  Daily work basis, high press demand for data and insights
-  Project awarded an government prize 

## Climate data

-  Proposal of a standardized methodology to build climate indicators for climate sensitive diseases analysis
-  Climate indicators (as temperature, precipitation, humidity) at the same time and spatial scale of diseases incidence (administrative regions)
-  Zonal indicators method
-  Publication at Environmental Data Science journal (2024)

## Postdoc project

-  Dengue incidence forecast with machine learning and subsets strategy
-  Health and climate data harmonization
-  Novel subsets approach, cluster based models with better performance

## Projects and ideas for the next years

-  Streamline health and climate data gathering projects
-  Expansion to other regions and countries
-  Provide methods and packages to compute health and climate indicators
-  Machine learning methods for data analysis and forecast

## Climate data

-  Provide regularly updated datasets of climate indicators at different administrative levels
-  Expand project coverage to other countries
-  Include synthetic indicators for water cycle and droughts, warm and cold spells, and extreme events

## Early Warning System for Climate Sensitive Diseases

-  Prevent and early detect CSD outbreaks
-  Actual EWS are limited on coverage, quality, interpretation and usage for decision making
-  Proposal of a EWS that follows WHO guidelines, expansible to other countries

## Early Warning System for Climate Sensitive Diseases

-  Application of machine learning methods to forecast incidence for short and medium-time horizons
-  Multivariate models with climate, environmental and socio-economic covariates
-  Subsets models to boost performance
-  Replicable to other countries

## Thanks!
