## Main fields of work and projects

-   [Data handling tools]{.hl}: author of ten R packages to handle health and climate datasets and indicators.

`{microdatasus}`, `{brpop}`, `{tidyrates}`, `{zendown}`, `{zenstats}`, `{nseq}`, `{rspell}`, `{brclimr}`, `{zonalclim}`, `{opendenguedata}`

-   [Visualization:]{.hl} malaria and COVID-19 interactive visualization dashboards (IRD-FR and Fiocruz-BR)
-   [Analysis and modeling]{.hl} of climate-sensitive diseases (Fiocruz-BR, LNCC-BR, BSC, Inria-FR, IRD-FR)

## Health and Climate indicators

-   Streamline methods, [expansion]{.hl} to other countries and continents
-   Provide [regularly updated datasets]{.hl} of health and climate indicators at standardized administrative geographic boundaries (level 2, level 3)
-   Usage of population estimates as [weighting]{.hl} factor
-   Build [synthetic indicators]{.hl} for water cycle and droughts, warm and cold spells, and extreme events

## Climate-Sensitive Diseases modeling

-   Dengue inflicts an important health burden in Brazil
    -   1 million new cases reported just in 2024, 214 deaths, official emergency status declaration
-   Project for [dengue incidence forecast]{.hl} on Brazil with machine learning methods
-   Novel subsets approach, cluster based models with better performance

## Early Warning Systems for CSD

-   [Framework]{.hl} proposal to prevent and early detect CSD outbreaks [adaptive]{.hl} to regions' contexts and priorities
-   Aligned with WHO guidelines
-   Close work with health managers and civil society representatives for project usage and tools appropriation
-   Traditional and machine learning multivariate models to forecast incidence for short and medium-time horizons (ARIMA, random forest, XGBoost, LSTM...)
-   Continuous model monitoring and update ([MLOps]{.hl})

## Integration with the Global Health Resilience group and projects 

-   [Toolkits]{.hl} development, maintenance and training. DAGs (directed acyclic graph) to integrate and monitor tools execution and results lifecycle
-   [Climate and health data]{.hl} methods and products, basis of different projects 
-   [ML]{.hl} methods and models for EWS 
-   Provide [interoperable]{.hl} data, methods and models to different projects, as HARMONIZE, IDAlert, IDExtremes, and E4Warning
