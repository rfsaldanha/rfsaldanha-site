## Abstract

Background: A large percentage of the population has not yet started vaccination, for which the increase in coverage is almost null. Methods: We used segmented regression analysis to estimate trends in the first dose coverage curve. Results: There has been a slowdown in the application of the first doses in Brazil since epidemiological week 36 (average percent change \[APC\] 0.83%, 95% confidence interval \[CI\] 0.75-0.91%), with a trend close to stagnation. Conclusions: It is important to develop strategies to increase access to vaccination posts. Furthermore, it is recommended to expand vaccination to children, thereby increasing the eligible population.
