Conducted at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (IOC), the project ArboAlvo's objective is to stratify arboviruses risk into national and intra-municipal levels, considering epidemiolocal, entomological, and socio-demographic dimensions.

I participated in this project by creating, reviewing, and optimizing code in the project data analysis, and developing data dashboards.
