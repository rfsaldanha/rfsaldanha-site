This was a very special project, where we were invited to develop a museum exhibition at Fiocruz. On this set, we present to the visitors the relationship between health and space by using interactive maps in a wide display and also with printed and tactile special maps for visually impaired visitors.

The exhibition is permanent and located at the Fiocruz Maré Campus.

The interactive map can also be accessed here: https://rfsaldanha.github.io/app_cavalarica/
