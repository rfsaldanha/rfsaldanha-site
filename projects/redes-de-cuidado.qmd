This project was a partnership with PCDaS and CDTS. The project studied the flow of cancer patients receiving treatment in Brazil between municipalities.

I was in charge to handle the large datasets about hospitalizations and treatments and perform some network analysis.

This work was supported by Inova Fiocruz and resulted in a published paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100153.
