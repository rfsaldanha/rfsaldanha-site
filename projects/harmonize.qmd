Harmonizing multi-scale spatiotemporal data for health in climate change hotspots.

Harmonize is a project in partnership with the Health and Climate Observatory and several international partners, including the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC).

The project's objective is to collect, organize and analyze multi-scale spatiotemporal data for health in climate hotspots.

I am working on this project to provide expert knowledge on Brazilian health data collection and analysis.

This work is supported by the Wellcome Trust grant number 224694/Z/21/Z.
