This project is a partnership between PCDaS and other researchers at Fiocruz and IBGE. The PNS is a national inquiry about the population health conditions with two editions: 2013 and 2019. Its results cover major aspects of populations' health and involve special techniques for complex samples.

I oversee the team at PCDaS responsible to create reproducible code notebooks about sample expansion and developing and maintain a website with project documentation and a data dashboard.
