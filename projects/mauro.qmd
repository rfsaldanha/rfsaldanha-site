"Mauro" was a research project that I initiated during my Ph.D. at Fiocruz, when I was taking some courses about technological information on health.

The objectives of the project were (1) to download and organize bibliometric information available at "Scielo" from the Public Health, and Brazil collections. (2) Provide a simple and intuitive way for researchers to access its data through filters and visualize information.

The ETL process and dashboard were developed with R and Shiny. The project is now deactivated.
