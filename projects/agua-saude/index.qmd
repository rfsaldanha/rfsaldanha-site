Água & Saúde was the first project that I got involved at Fiocruz with the Climate and Health Observatory. It was a project in partnership with ANA (Agência Nacional das Águas).

I was in charge to create a database of health and water indicators and a data dashboard. The project was fully developed with R, Shiny, and SQLite technologies.

The project has been discontinued.
