"Projeto Mais Médicos" was the first project that I got involved with at Fiocruz, through the PCDaS initiative. I was in charge of developing a data dashboard and to coordinate a team with other research assistants.

The project aimed to present data about a federal project called "Mais Médicos", where a public health policy encouraged MDs to work in less developed regions in Brazil and also contracted foreign MDs from Cuba and other countries to work on those regions.

The project has been discontinued.
