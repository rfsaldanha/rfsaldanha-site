## Description

ECCMID 2024 will follow the successful format introduced in 2022, offering a comprehensive hybrid congress. While we encourage the majority of our faculty, abstract presenters, and attendees, to participate on-site and benefit from the scientific, educational and networking experiences, provided by ECCMID, our seamless hybrid solution allows remote attendance for those unable to travel for any reason. Whether you come and join us in Barcelona, Spain or sign in online from your living room or office, you will be able to fully enjoy what ECCMID 2024 has to offer.
