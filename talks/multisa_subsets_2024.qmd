## Introduction

-   Abundant [multivariate time series]{.hl}, good opportunity for forecasting [machine learning]{.hl} methods
-   Data may present intrinsic [diversity]{.hl} of samples, affecting model's performance on [different parts of the input]{.hl}
-   [Global models]{.hl}: use all available time series
-   [Local models]{.hl}: use only time series pertaining to each sample
-   [Data subsets models]{.hl}: our proposal

## Objective

-   Propose a [subset modeling framework]{.hl}
-   Accommodate [regional variations]{.hl} across diverse units (e.g. municipalities)
-   Cost-effective training with [robust prediction capabilities]{.hl} in comparison with global models

## Subset modeling framework

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
1.  Identify subsets within the dataset with similar patterns
2.  Train models for each subset
3.  Use the model trained on the subset data for prediction

## Case example

-   [Dengue]{.hl} disease is transmitted by mosquitoes and is a Public Health concern. Record number cases on 2024 in Brazil, tendency to increase with global warming
-   A typical forecasting model is targeted to predict number of cases based on [climate indicators]{.hl} (rain and temperature)
-   A [global model]{.hl} would use data from all municipalities, facing [difficulties]{.hl} related to [distinct]{.hl} temporal and spatial disease [transmission patterns]{.hl}

## Datasets

-   Dengue dataset. Weekly cases count, from 2011 to 2020, for 333 municipalities.
-   Climate dataset. Average maximum and minimum temperature, total precipitation. Same time and spatial units and coverage.
-   All indicators were standardized (with zero mean and one SD)

## Experimental setup

-   [Identify]{.hl} data subsets considering dengue cases and covariates patterns across municipalities with DTW distance.
    -   Select the [optimum]{.hl} number of subsets ($k$) considering silhouette score
-   Train random forest [Global Model]{.hl} with and without the [subset id]{.hl} feature information
-   Train random forest [Subsets Models]{.hl} 
-   [Evaluate]{.hl} forecasting model's [performance]{.hl} on test data

## Clustering results

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   $k = 5$ returned the highest silhouette score
-   Partition sizes: $g_1 = 69$, $g_2 = 62$, $g_3 = 82$, $g_4 = 102$, $g_5 = 18$

## Conclusions and next steps

-   We specifically addressed and formalized the subsets approach in a multivariate time series setting
-   Subsets models rendered [better performance]{.hl} than global models on [116 municipalities]{.hl} from 333 (34.83\%)
-   Subsets models overall performance is related to the [partition's size]{.hl}. Bigger partitions (more municipalities) have more training data.
-   Further work may advance on clustering strategies (constraints in size and featured-based approaches) and apply different learners on model training
