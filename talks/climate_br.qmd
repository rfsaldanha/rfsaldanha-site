## Overview

-   Climate raw data sources: ground level and reanalysis
-   Data on Braziliam municipalities spatial unit
-   Climatological normals and indicators

## Ground-level climate data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Weather stations on CametÃ¡ and Mocajuba (north region)
-   Data every 5 minutes, sent to Fiocruz Postgres server
-   `{plugfieldapi}` package to retrieve data from stations with daily e-mail reports
-   Error detection and notification for problems

## ReAnalysis climate data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   [ERA5-Land]{.hl}: global coverage, hourly and daily data, regular updates
-   [BR-DWGD]{.hl}: Brazil coverage, daily data, sensible to extreme events, sporadic updates
-   [TerraClimate]{.hl}: global coverage, monthly data, higher resolution (\~4km), regular updates

## Climate data for Brazilian municipalities

-   Zonal statistics computation
-   Adoption of `{exactextractr}` package for cell's coverage weighted computations
-   Creation of package `{zonalclim}` with helper functions to compute scalable zonal statistics with chunks strategy
-   DAG system using the `{targets}` package to compute climate zonal statistics for Brazilian municipalities
-   Publication on Environmental Data Science journal

More details [here](https://rfsaldanha.github.io/data-projects/brazil-climate-zonal-indicators.html)

## Example

![](../data-projects/images/zonal_brdwgd-01.png)

## Climatological normals

-   Climatological normals are computed only for weather stations and municipal references are needed for better climate change understanding
-   Normals computed for each Brazilian municipality using the Zonal BR-DWGD from 1961 to 1990
    -   Mean, 10th and 90th percentile
    -   Temperature (max, min), precipitation, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and evapotranspiration

## Time-aggregated indicators

-   Municipal daily data time series to monthly indicators
-   Monthly statistics
    -   Average, median, standard deviation, standard error, maximum and minimum values, and percentiles
-   Occurence of events
    -   22 indicators, in reference to normals or count sequence. Creation of `{nseq}` package
    -   Heat waves, cold spells, count of warm days, count of dry and wet days, and others

```

## Future work

-   Compute zonal statistics weighted by populated areas
-   Create other time-aggregated indicators
-   Test the methodologies on other countries
