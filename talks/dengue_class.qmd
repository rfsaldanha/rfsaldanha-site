## The case itinerary

-   After a clinical assessement, a patient can be pointed as a [suspected dengue/chikungunya case]{.hl}, based on its symptoms, clinical conditions and history (anamnesis)
    -   Fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and retroorbital pain
-   The suspected case is [immediately notified]{.hl} to the health authorities (SINAN dataset)
-   The diagnosis must be [verified]{.hl} to adequate the health treatment

## Possible case classifications 

-   Suspected case
-   Confirmed case: dengue or chikungunya
-   Discarded case

## How a case is confirmed or discarded?

-   On normal conditions
    -   Primarly by laboratory exams (blood tests)
    -   Nucleic acid amplification tests, serologic tests, and IgG antibody tests.
-   On outbreaks
    -   By laboratorial test, if available
    -   Or by the [doctor's judgment]{.hl}, based on symptoms, clinical conditions and the patient history

## Dengue cases diagnosis and criteria

## Dengue cases diagnosis and criteria

|Diagnosis            | Laboratory | Clinical |
|---------------------|------------|----------|
|Positive Dengue      |3,624,320   |6,130,030 |
|Positive Chikungunya |300,429     |502,977   |
|Discarded            |1,304,000   |1,052,512 |


## Research objectives

-   Train a ML model to predict a patient's diagnosis based on its symptoms and clinical conditions
-   Evaluate the performance of the model for cases screening during dengue outbreaks
-   Assess the human performance on diagnosis based on the trained model

## Previous works

-   Neto (2022) present a systematic literature review on ML and DL techniques to support
clinical diagnoses of arboviral diseases. 
    -   Current research is focused on binary classification of Dengue diagnosis. 
    -   None of the reviewed papers were trained to predict Dengue and or Chikungunya diagnosis with Brazilian data
    -   Maximum number of records of 14,019 was used for training and testing ML models

## Previous works

-   Tabosa (2022) present a comparative study of ML techniques for multi-class classification of
arboviral diseases
    -   Data restricted to Amazonas and the city of Recife, Pernambuco, from 2015 to 2020.
    -   Gradient-boosting learners offered the best performance
    -   No learner achieved an accuracy above 70%

## Previous works

-   Bohm (2024) present a model for binary classification with 98% accuracy
    -   Data restricted to Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais states
    -   Sample of 20,000 records
    -   Possible discrepancies between paper methodology and available data from author


## Study design

1.  Create two datasets: $D_a$ with cases that received diagnosis from laboratorial exams, and $D_b$ containing only cases diagnosed solely on symptoms and clinical conditions
2.  Train different ML learners on $D_a$ based on the patient's symptoms and clinical conditions
3.  Model evaluation
4.  Apply the selected model on $D_b$
5.  Compare the results

## Preliminary results

-   $D_a$ with 50,000 ramdom samples for each class: positive Dengue, positive Chikungunya, and discarded cases
-   Training dataset with 3/4 proportion, 5 folds
-   Learners: XG-Boosting, Random Forest, KNN, MLP, Logistic Regression, and Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA) model
-   Three cumulative model especifications: symptoms and clinical conditions, weather season and geographical region (state)

## Best model, so far

-   Complete model especification
-   XG-Boost learner
-   64,28% accurracy
-   64,28% sensibility
-   82,14% specificity
-   81,73% ROC AUC

## Confusion matrix

  Positive Chikungunya      2788                 9942            1362
  Positive Dengue           4272                 1381            8723

## Human vs machine

## Thoughts

-   Sensitivity: ability to designate an individual with disease as positive
-   Specificity: ability to designate an individual who does not have a disease as negative
-   For cases screening, a high specificity is desired: ruled-in cases can be directed to laboratory diagnosis for confirmation

## Strenghts of the paper, so far

-   Country-wide representative sample
-   Relatively high specificity model
-   More realistic discussion on ML models for cases screening 
-   New discussion on human performance
