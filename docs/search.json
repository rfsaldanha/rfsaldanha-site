Online data access and viewing is free and open, using tables and graphs of aggregate data and access to raw data. However, the current form of data access does not fully meet the demands by health system administrators and other users for a flexible, user-friendly tool that allows dealing with various relevant health issues in the knowledge search and decision-making.

We used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) results to understand changing health patterns and inform policy responses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed GBD 2016 estimates for life expectancy at birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and risk factors for Brazil, its 26 states, and the Federal District from 1990 to 2016, and compared these with national estimates for ten comparator countries.\n\n\nFindings\nNationally, LE increased from 68·4 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 68·0–68·9) in 1990 to 75·2 years (74·7–75·7) in 2016, and HALE increased from 59·8 years (57·1–62·1) to 65·5 years (62·5–68·0). All-cause agestandardised mortality rates decreased by 34·0% (33·4–34·5), while all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 30·2% (27·7–32·8); the magnitude of declines varied among states. In 2016, ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of age-standardised YLLs, followed by interpersonal violence. Low back and neck pain, sense organ diseases, and skin diseases were the main causes of YLDs in 1990 and 2016. Leading risk factors contributing to DALYs in 2016 were alcohol and drug use, high blood pressure, and high body-mass index.\n\n\nInterpretation\nHealth improved from 1990 to 2016, but improvements and disease burden varied between states. An epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases and related risks occurred nationally, but later in some states, while interpersonal violence grew as a health concern. Policy makers can use these results to address health disparities.\n\n\nFunding\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Brazilian Ministry of Health."

Investigar a associação do LFS com fatores sociodemográficos, apoio social, autoavaliação do estado de saúde e perfil de acesso aos serviços de saúde em mulheres assistidas pela Estratégia de Saúde da Família (ESF). Método. Estudo transversal, conduzido em 2015-2016, em duas Unidades de Atenção Primária à Saúde cobertas pela ESF, de um município da região Sudeste do Brasil. A amostra foi composta por 439 mulheres, entre 25 e 64 anos. O LFS foi avaliado por meio do Brief Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (B-TOFHLA). Efetuaram-se cálculos da razão de prevalência (RP). Posteriormente, construiu-se um modelo de regressão de Poisson de variância robusta, sendo admitida significância estatística quando p ≤0,05. Resultados. Foi constatado que 53,5% das mulheres apresentaram um baixo LFS, o qual associou-se à idade superior aos 40 anos (RP = 1,18; IC 95%: 1,07-1,31), ao grau de instrução inferior ao ensino médio completo (RP = 1,26; IC 95%: 1,15-1,38), à baixa renda (RP = 1,13; IC 95%: 1,04-1,23) e à autodeclaração da cor parda ou preta (RP= 1,06; IC 95%: 1,01-1,12). Conclusão. Os resultados acentuaram a importância do LFS como estratégia para a abordagem de populações com maior vulnerabilidade socioeconômica."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nDue to its impact, COVID-19 has been stressing the academy to search for curing, mitigating, or controlling it. It is believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the InfoGripe. InfoGripe targets notifications of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the combination of data analytics (event detection methods) and time series modeling (inertia and novelty concepts) over hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016–2019). The expected cases are derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil. The states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso have the highest rates of under-reporting of cases. The rate of under-reporting of deaths is high in the Rio Grande do Sul and the Minas Gerais. This work can be highlighted for the combination of data analytics and time series modeling. Our calculation of under-reporting rates based on SARI is conservative and better characterized by deaths than for cases."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study addressed health regionalization on various spatial scales based on patient flow. The article analyzed data through data linkage on the origin and destination of admissions at the municipal level in Brazil in 2016. The analysis is based on graph theory and uses a modularity algorithm that seeks to group municipalities in communities with a large number of interlinks. The algorithm optimizes the number of hospital admissions and discharges, taking patient flow into account. The results are shown, considering different political and administrative spatial structures. Considering patient flow without spatial restrictions, 29 communities were created in the country, compared to 64 communities when the boundaries of the major geographic regions were respected, and 164 when considering only patient flows within the respective states. The results show the importance of historically constituted regions, ignoring formal administrative boundaries, in order to implement access to health services. They also reveal adherence to administrative boundaries in many states of Brazil, demonstrating this spatial scale’s importance in the context of access to hospital admissions. The methodology makes relevant contributions to regional health planning."

Variables from different parts of the questionnaire were analyzed to cover proportions with different magnitudes. The prevalence of obesity was included in the analysis since anthropometry measurement in the 2019 survey was performed in a subsample. The value of the point estimate, CV, and the Deff were calculated for each indicator, considering the stratification of the primary sampling units, the weighting of the sampling units, and the clustering effect. The CV and the Deff were lower in the 2019 estimates for most indicators. Concerning the questionnaire indicators of all household members, the Deffs were high and reached values greater than 18 for having a health insurance plan. Regarding the indicators of the individual questionnaire, for the prevalence of obesity, the Deff ranged from 2.7 to 4.2, in 2013, and from 2.7 to 10.2, in 2019. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes per Federative Unit had a higher CV and lower Deff. Expanding the sample size to meet the diverse health objectives and the high Deff are significant challenges for developing probabilistic household-based national survey. New probabilistic sampling strategies should be considered to reduce costs and clustering effects."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nIn 2017, inhabitants along the border between French Guiana and Brazil were affected by a malaria outbreak primarily due to Plasmodium vivax (Pv). While malaria cases have steadily declined between 2005 and 2016 in this Amazonian region, a resurgence was observed in 2017.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo investigations were performed according to different spatial scales and information details: (1) a local study on the French Guiana border, which enabled a thorough investigation of malaria cases treated at a local village health center and the entomological circumstances in the most affected neighborhood, and (2) a regional and cross-border study, which enabled exploration of the regional spatiotemporal epidemic dynamic. Number and location of malaria cases were estimated using French and Brazilian surveillance systems.\n\n\nResults\nOn the French Guianese side of the border in Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock, the attack rate was 5.5% (n = 4000), reaching 51.4% (n = 175) in one Indigenous neighborhood. Entomological findings suggest a peak of Anopheles darlingi density in August and September. Two female An. darlingi (n = 1104, 0.18%) were found to be Pvpositive during this peak. During the same period, aggregated data from passive surveillance conducted by Brazilian and French Guianese border health centers identified 1566 cases of Pv infection. Temporal distribution during the 2007–2018 period displayed seasonal patterns with a peak in November 2017. Four clusters were identified among epidemic profiles of cross-border area localities. All localities of the first two clusters were Brazilian. The localization of the first cluster suggests an onset of the outbreak in an Indigenous reservation, subsequently expanding to French Indigenous neighborhoods and non-Native communities.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current findings demonstrate a potential increase in malaria cases in an area with otherwise declining numbers. This is a transborder region where human mobility and remote populations challenge malaria control programs. This investigation illustrates the importance of international border surveillance and collaboration for malaria control, particularly in Indigenous villages and mobile populations."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nGeographic accessibility to healthcare services is a fundamental component in achieving universal health coverage, the central commitment of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). For cancer patients, poor accessibility has been associated with inadequate treatment, worse prognosis, and poorer quality of life.\n\n\nMethods\nWe explored nationwide healthcare data from the SUS health information systems, and mapped the geographic accessibility to cancer treatment in two time-frames: 2009–2010 and 2017–2018. We applied social network analysis (SNA) to estimate the commuting route, flow, and distances travelled by cancer patients to undergo surgical, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy treatment.\n\n\nFindings\nA total of 12,751,728 treatment procedures were analyzed. Overall, more than half of the patients (49·2 to 60·7%) needed to travel beyond their municipality of residence for treatment, a fact that did not change over time. Marked regional differences were observed, as patients living in the northern and midwestern regions of the country had to travel longer distances (weighted average of 296 to 870 km). Cancer care hubs and attraction poles were mostly identified in the southeast and northeast regions, with Barretos being the main hub for all types of treatment throughout time.\n\n\nInterpretation\nImportant regional disparities in the accessibility to cancer treatment in Brazil were revealed, suggesting the need to review the distribution of specialized care in the country. The data presented here contribute to ongoing research on improving access to cancer care and can provide reference to other countries, offering relevant data for oncological and healthcare service evaluation, monitoring, and strategic planning.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was funded by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation - Fiocruz (Inova - no. 8451635123 to BPF) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (no. 407060/2018–9 to BPF); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel – CAPES (scholarship to PCA, Finance Code 001); and Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia de Inovação em Doenças de Populações Negligenciadas (INCT-IDPN)."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nCross-border malaria is a significant obstacle to achieving malaria control and elimination worldwide. Objective: This study aimed to build a cross-border surveillance system that can make comparable and qualified data available to all parties involved in malaria control between French Guiana and Brazil.\n\n\nMethods\nData reconciliation rules based on expert knowledge were defined and applied to the heterogeneous data provided by the existing malaria surveillance systems of both countries. Visualization dashboards were designed to facilitate progressive data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. Dedicated advanced open source and robust software solutions were chosen to facilitate solution sharing and reuse.\n\n\nResults\nA database gathering the harmonized data on cross-border malaria epidemiology is updated monthly with new individual malaria cases from both countries. Online dashboards permit a progressi ve and user-friendly visualization of raw data and epidemiological indicators, in the form of time series, maps, and data quality indexes. The monitoring system was shown to be able to identify changes in time series that are related to control actions, as well as differentiated changes according to space and to population subgroups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis cross-border monitoring tool could help produce new scientific evidence on cross-border malaria dynamics, implementing cross-border cooperation for malaria control and elimination, and can be quickly adapted to other cross-border contexts."

The availability of historical neonatal mortality rates (NMR) data in Brazilian municipalities is crucial to evaluate trends at local, regional and national level, identifying gaps and vulnerable territories. Therefore, the objective of this article is to offer an integrated dataset containing monthly data in a historical series from 1996 to 2017 with information on all births, neonatal deaths, and NMR (total, early and late components) enriched with information related to the municipality."

Its original data is at hourly interval, and monthly aggregates are also available at the Copernicus Data Store (CDS).\nFor some applications like Climate-Sensitive Diseases (CSD) modelling, the hourly interval may be too much detailed, but the monthly aggregation is too coarse.\nFor this reason, I created daily aggregates from some ERA5-Land indicators for the Latin America region."

    "text": "Introduction\nClimate indicators are used on several statistical models for many research areas and are specially important for modelling Climate Sensitive Diseases (CSD) incidence. Those models usually adopts a lattice structure, where its data is aggregated at administrative boundaries (e.g. disease incidence), but climate indicators are usually presented in a continuous regular grid format.\nTo make climate indicators compatible with lattice structures, zonal statistics may be adopted. Zonal statistics are descriptive statistics calculated using a set of cells that spatially intersects a given spatial boundary. For each boundary in a map, statistics like average, maximum value, minimum value, standard deviation, and sum are obtained to represent the cell’s values that intersect the boundary.\nI created some zonal statistics of climate indicators datasets for Brazilian municipalities from some climate data products and a R package called brclimr to retrieve this data."

The package allows downloading and preprocessing data from various health information systems, with the inclusion of labeling categorical fields in the files. The download function was capable of directly accessing and reducing the workload for the selection of microdata files and variables in DATASUS, while the preprocessing function enabled automatic coding of various categorical fields. The package thus enables a continuous workflow in the same program, in which the algorithm allows downloading and preprocessing and other packages in R allow analyzing data from the health information systems in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS)."

Métodos: Inquérito de saúde, realizado pela internet, com amostragem em cadeia, no período de 24 de abril a 24 de maio de 2020. A intensidade da adesão à restrição de contato físico foi analisada segundo características sociodemográficas, utilizando-se modelos de regressão logística para investigar associações com ‘Nenhuma/pouca adesão’. Resultados: Dos 45.161 participantes, 74,2% (73,8-74,6%) relataram intensa adesão às medidas. O grupo que não aderiu às medidas foi composto homens (31,7%), com idade de 30 a 49 anos (36,4%), baixa escolaridade (33,0%), trabalhando durante a pandemia (81,3%), residentes nas regiões Norte (28,1%) e Centro-Oeste (28,5%) do país. Houve importante redução das taxas de crescimento diário, de 45,4 para 5,0%. Conclusão: Grande parte da população brasileira aderiu às medidas de restrição de contato físico, o que, possivelmente, contribuiu para reduzir a disseminação da COVID-19."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe success of machine learning (ML) systems depends on data availability, volume, quality, and efficient computing resources. A challenge in this context is to reduce computational costs while maintaining adequate accuracy of the models. This paper presents a framework to address this challenge. The idea is to identify “subdomains” within the input space, train local models that produce better predictions for samples from that specific subdomain, instead of training a single global model on the full dataset. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets. Our results indicate that subset modelling (i) improves the predictive performance compared to a single global model and (ii) allows data-efficient training."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nThe term big data is no longer new in the academic environment and has become more common in scientific publications and research grants, leading to a profound revision of the way science is being made and taught.\n\n\nObjective\nTo reflect on the possible changes that data science can induce in population and health related studies\n\n\nMethod\nTo foster this debate, scientific articles selected from the big data field in health and demography were contrasted with books and other scientific productions.\n\n\nResults\nIt is argued that volume is not the most promising characteristic of big data for population and health related studies, but rather the complexity of data and the possibilities of integration with traditional studies by means of interdisciplinary teams.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn population and health related studies, the possibilities of integration between new and traditional methods are broad, and include new toolboxes for analysis, monitoring, prediction of events (cases) and health-disease processes in the population, and for the study of sociodemographic and environmental determinants."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study aims to analyze the flow of breast cancer patients treated outside of their municipality of residence, based on hospital admissions and chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) from 2014 to 2016. Network analysis was used, considering the municipality of residence and of treatment as nodes in a graph, thus consisting of a “health system organizational network study”. In addition, highway distances and travel time were estimated via the best feasible route according to the Open Street Maps highway project. According to the results, 51.34% of breast cancer patients in Brazil were treated outside their municipality of residence, following regionalized flows that respect state borders, generally towards the state capital or other large cities. The results also point to specific exceptions, where some municipalities occupy outstanding positions that extrapolate state borders. Median travel time from the municipality of residence to the municipality of care was nearly 3 hours, and 75% of trips totaled 324km for chemotherapy, 287km for radiotherapy, and 282km for hospitalizations. These results are indicative of the difficulties in access to oncology services, potentially aggravating the illness experience with cancer in terms of impact on the individuals and their families."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Low polio vaccine coverage can result in the spread of Poliovirus to areas free from viral circulation. This study analyzed the temporal trends and spatial distribution of polio vaccine coverage for children under five years of age in Brazil, between 2011 and 2021. Methods: This is an ecological, time-series study (2011 to 2021) with annual vaccine coverages against poliomyelitis, extracted from the Information System of the National Immunization Program from regions of the 27 Brazilian states. The percentage reductions in vaccination coverage in Brazil and in the Regions were calculated. Prais-Winsten regression models were used to analyze time series for the Regions and States, and spatial analysis identified the distribution of clusters (high-high; low-low; high-low and lowhigh) of vaccination coverages across Brazilian municipalities, using a 5% significance level. Results: From 2011 to 2021, the coverage of polio vaccines decreased by 46.1%. There was a progressive increase observed in clusters resulting in low vaccination coverages (136 low-low Brazilian municipalities in 2011 vs 614 in 2021), mostly reported in the North and Northeast regions of the country. There was a downward trend in vaccination coverages in 8 of the 27 States (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: The reduction in polio vaccine coverage, as observed in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, may favor the spread of Poliovirus. Therefore, vaccination strategies should be prioritized for children residing in areas with sharp and recurrent declines in vaccination coverages, including travelers, migrants and refugees."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjectives\nConcerns about the increasing impact of severe COVID-19 in younger individuals in Brazil came after a recent synchronised country-wide wave of cases in Brazil. This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18–49 years and ≥70 years.\n###Study design Longitudinal study based on secondary data.\n\n\nMethods\nData from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and variation of younger (18–49 years) and older (≥70 years) adults who were hospitalised between 15th March 2020 and 19th June 2021.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults but decreased in younger adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in epidemiological weeks (EW) 19–48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 (18–49 y, mean = 26.1%; ≥70 y, mean = 32.8%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 44.9% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 19/2021 (14.1%) and reaching 17.3% in EW 24/2021.\n\n\nConclusions\nAn increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. government financial support). Potential consequences of COVID-19 hospitalisations in younger adults could include a reduced life expectancy of the population and an increased number of people unable to perform daily activities due to post-COVID-19 conditions."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe aim of this paper is to revisit the debate on the degree of specialization and industrial diversification and the growth of local manufacturing employment in Brazil. A matrix of sectoral spillovers is built in which it is verified whether sectors, grouped by technological intensity, influence the performance of disaggregated manufacturing groups. Spatial data panel techniques are used to control non-observed local effects and possible spatial dependence over the period 1995-2014. The results show that specializations in low-technology manufacturing groups create stimulus for several other manufacturing groups regardless of the level of technological intensity. The spillovers coming from high technology manufacturing industries are less frequent, though they also occur depending on the industrial manufacturing group considered. In general, sectors of higher and lower technological intensity flourish with the presence of MAR externalities. We conclude that the diversification/specialization debate can vary considerably, requiring specific industrial and regional policies by manufacturing industries."
